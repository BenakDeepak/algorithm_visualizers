# Algorithm Visualizers

We have developed a series of visualizers that illustrate fundamental algorithms, designed to enhance understanding and serve as educational tools. Here are some of our key projects:

AVL Tree Visualizer:
This interactive web app, built with Streamlit, allows users to visualize AVL tree construction in real-time. Users can upload files or manually input numbers to observe step-by-step updates of the tree structure. Features include traversal results, immediate feedback on user inputs, and detailed visualizations, making it an ideal tool for learning and teaching AVL trees interactively.

Heap Sort Visualizer:
Our Heap Sort visualizer offers a comprehensive step-by-step breakdown of the sorting process, allowing users to explore the inner workings of this efficient algorithm. The tool provides clear visualizations, helping users understand the process and its efficiency compared to other sorting algorithms. Itâ€™s a valuable resource for students and enthusiasts looking to gain insights into Heap Sort.

Graph Coloring Visualizer:
This tool visualizes graph coloring using a greedy algorithm. Users can input their own graphs or generate random ones, with the tool efficiently handling and coloring the graphs in real-time. It serves as an excellent resource for exploring algorithmic solutions to problems such as chromatic number determination, with an intuitive interface for ease of use.

These visualizers are designed to be engaging and educational, making complex algorithms easier to understand for learners of all levels.
